The config.php file also has some important security-related elements:

Encryption Key Handling:

It uses SODIUM_CRYPTO_AEAD_AES256GCM_KEYBYTES and SODIUM_CRYPTO_AEAD_AES256GCM_NPUBBYTES for the encryption keys, 
which are better practices compared to simpler hashing methods. However, hardcoding the keys (ENCRYPTKEY_PASS and AES_IV_PASS) remains risky.

The code tries to ensure that the encryption keys meet certain length requirements and applies hashing to generate the keys, 
but since the base values (ENCRYPTKEY_PASS and AES_IV_PASS) are still hardcoded, they can be exploited if the file is compromised.


PHP Version Check:

The script checks that the PHP version is at least 7.2.0, which is a good practice to avoid vulnerabilities present in older versions.



Inclusion of chat-conf.php:

The script includes the chat-conf.php file, which contains sensitive data like encryption keys and database 
credentials. Since that file is hardcoded into this script, it presents a risk if the file permissions are not strictly controlled.





Security Recommendations:

Encryption Key Handling: As mentioned previously, avoid hardcoding encryption keys and store them securely (e.g., via environment variables or a 
secrets management system).


Access Control: Ensure that both this and the chat-conf.php file are properly secured with appropriate file permissions to prevent unauthorized access.


PHP Version Management: Make sure that the PHP version being used is up-to-date with the latest security patches to prevent known vulnerabilities 
from being exploited.
